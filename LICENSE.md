This License seeks to establish the following in the context of those that use the License and the code that it covers:

As a steward of this earth and responsible for the ideas and code the author has come up with, you are hereby given the right to use, modify, and distribute the code in it's entirety for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, without any restrictions except for the following:
